title: Why the hell do I use new unity UI system ?
---

I shouldn't.

It's 1000 times more difficult to use. Difficult to extend. Difficult to create new controls. It takes much longer to create something in uGUI than in imGUI.

Poor collection of UI controls. In imGUI you can build new controls in minutes.
<br>

Yes, it's open source, but what's the use of it ? When you have to build everything yourself...
<br>

I am a fool, which once again believed to Unity. Don't listen to them, don't listen what they say is the future, but instead work with things that are easier. Things that are easy and powerfull as imGUI.
<br>

At least, it doesn't take much work to integrate imGUI and uGUI.
<br>

From now on, I will be using imGUI for whatever I can.
