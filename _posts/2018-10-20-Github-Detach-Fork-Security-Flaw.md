title: Github security flaw when detaching fork
---

The only (reliable) way to detach github fork into a standalone repository is to contact github support. It can be done via web form, where you should enter your name and email, and send request to them.

That's what I did for my own repo. In a couple of hours I got the response that the job is done. And it really was.

**But they didn't verify my identity.** Which means that anyone can impersonate another user and detach his fork.

When I told them about this, they replied that they have a specific process to follow in cases like this - which is a total crap, because once a fork is detached, it's gonna be a little hard to get it back. And who knows what else can be done by contacting them...
